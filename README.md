# LAPR4-1920

## What can I find here?

The code for the curricular unit of LAPR4 of LEI-ISEP. This code is related to the management of a factory floor, with interations between machines and user. The code is separated in modules, with the user-interaction being handled by Java and the server-side (we used virtual machines provided by ISEP) being handled by C.

## Structure

- Backoffice Console
- Bootstrap + Bootstrappers
- SCM
- SMM
- SPM
- Machine Simulator
- Multiple Running Scripts

Please note that there are .sh scrips for Linux and .bat scripts for Windows, simply grant running authorization and run then in your machines.

The folder 'wiki' has all the documentation generated by us refering to the project.
